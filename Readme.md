#Simple.Data.SqlServer
Simple.Data.SqlServer is an ADO provider for the Simple.Data framework by Mark Rendle.

##Supported SqlAnywhere version
Initial development and testing will be carried out on version 12.0.1 with planned support for versions 8.0.3 upwards.

##Genesis
The initial code & test assemblies were taken from the SQL Server code & test assemblies and therefore it should be pretty easy to transfer skills from SQL Server to SQL Anywhere.

##Requirements
iAnywhere.Data.SQLAnywhere.v4.0.dll version 12.0.1 from the SQL Anywhere installation - http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/sqlanywhere
